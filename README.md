django-cemese
=============

This is a personal project that holds a lot of tools, utils, abstract models..
that are reusable on my own projects.

There is no itention to became a helper lib or something special.


django-ckeditor improvements
----------------------------

There are two improvements available on the app "cemese.ckeditor"

 * Better file upload (slugify filename and no error if upload is not a image when trying to generate thumb)
 * static files when using "collectstatic" not available on "django-ckeditor"
